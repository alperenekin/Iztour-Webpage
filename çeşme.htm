		<h2>History Of Çeşme</h2>
	</div>
	<p>According to Pausanias, Erythrai (Ildırı) was founded by the Cretans. The city, ruled by the tyrants in the 7th century BC, entered the rule of Lydia in 560 BC. 
	The city remained under Persian rule until it was liberated by Alexander. The walls are surrounded by beautiful stone work. In the archaeological studies conducted in the city, 
	the Temple of Athena and the Theater dated to the 2nd half of the 7th century BC were unearthed.</p>
	<p>The Çeşme region was introduced to the Turkish sovereignty at the end of the 11th century with the great Turkish seaman Çaka Bey. The transition to Ottoman sovereignty was at the end of the 14th century. 
	One of the most striking Ottoman works is the Çeşme Castle. The artifacts in Çeşme and its surroundings are exhibited in the museum in Çeşme Castle. In addition to the castle there is a caravanserai.</p>
	<p>According to the Ottoman census of 1893, the number of people living in Çeşme was 30.702. At this date, 88% of the population of Çesme was composed of 26,826 Greeks. The rate of Turks was 12%.</p>
